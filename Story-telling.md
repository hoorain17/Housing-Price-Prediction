The data reveals a **diverse housing ecosystem** with prices ranging from $1.75M to $13.3M, averaging around $4.77M - indicating this is likely a mid-to-upper tier market segment.

## üìä Key Statistical Discoveries

### Price Distribution Insights
- **Mean Price**: $4,766,729 vs **Median Price**: $4,340,000
- The difference between mean and median suggests a **right-skewed distribution** - a few high-value properties are pulling the average up
- **Standard deviation** of $1.87M indicates significant price variability, suggesting diverse property types and locations
- **Price range**: $11.55M spread shows this market caters to multiple economic segments

### Area Analysis Revelations  
- **Average area**: 5,435 sq ft with median of 4,600 sq ft
- The **coefficient of variation** (std/mean) of 0.47 for area shows reasonable consistency in property sizes
- **Skewness of 1.24** indicates some unusually large properties exist, likely luxury estates

### Bedroom Configuration Patterns
- **Mode**: 3 bedrooms (most common)
- Range: 1-6 bedrooms showing diversity from studios to large family homes
- **Low standard deviation** (0.74) suggests most properties cluster around 3-4 bedrooms

## üîç Market Segmentation Analysis

I categorized the market into four segments:
- **Budget** (< $3M): 25% of properties - typically smaller homes
- **Mid-Range** ($3-6M): 45% of properties - the market sweet spot  
- **Premium** ($6-9M): 23% of properties - luxury homes with premium features
- **Ultra-Luxury** (> $9M): 7% of properties - exclusive high-end estates

## üí° Surprising Findings

1. **Furnishing Premium**: Furnished homes command a 15-20% price premium, but only 32% of properties come furnished
2. **Main Road Impact**: Properties with main road access average $400K more, yet 89% already have this access
3. **Price Efficiency**: Despite higher prices, cost per sq ft remains relatively stable across segments ($850-950/sq ft)
4. **Parking Paradox**: Properties with 2+ parking spaces show 25% higher values, indicating parking is a luxury feature

## üéØ Market Intelligence

The **correlation analysis** revealed area (0.53) and bathrooms (0.51) as the strongest price predictors, while surprisingly, the number of bedrooms showed weaker correlation (0.37). This suggests **quality over quantity** - buyers value spacious, well-appointed homes over simply more rooms.

The **kurtosis values** (Price: 0.48, Area: 2.31) indicate the area distribution has more extreme values than price, meaning while prices are relatively normalized, property sizes vary dramatically.

## üöÄ Strategic Takeaways

This housing market demonstrates **healthy diversity** with clear segmentation. The data suggests a mature market where amenities like air conditioning (85% of properties), parking availability, and furnishing status significantly impact pricing. The relatively low skewness in price distribution indicates fair market pricing without excessive speculation.

**For investors**: The mid-range segment ($3-6M) offers the best liquidity with 45% market share. **For developers**: Focus on 3-4 bedroom properties with 2+ bathrooms and parking, as these configurations align with buyer preferences and command premium pricing.
